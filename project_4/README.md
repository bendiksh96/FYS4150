Good afternoon, eager reader! 
Before handling any of these files, I suggest you know how they are structured and how they work!


Problem 4-5:

Run p4_4_5.cpp by typing the command: --> g++ p4_4_5.cpp -larmadillo -o p4_4_5 --> ./p4_4_5


Problem 6:

Run p4_6.cpp by typing the command: --> g++ p4_6.cpp -larmadillo -o p4_6 --> ./p4_6

Problem 9:

Run p4.cpp by typing the command: --> g++ p4.cpp -larmadillo -fopenmp -o p4 --> ./p4


In order to plot the data, do be sure that you adhere to these considerations:
    
    
    * Make sure you update the directory
    
    * Make sure that you run the data of the programs in the prior tasks
    
    * Make sure that the file names are in order 
    
    *If it does not work, please contact: daniel.kalvik@fys.uio.no
